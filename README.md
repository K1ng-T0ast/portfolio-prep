## About Me

1. White-Hot Key Strokes, or maybe T0asty Fireside Chat, or just T0asty Coding.

2. Making the world a better place than when I found it, one byte at a time. To one day make software that assists those who need it most and inspire those who may not need help to unlock the better parts of themselves. 

3. *Before starting a software development learning path at Code Fellows Academy, I was in sales enablement support for a fortune 500 company. I'm investing my time into Python because I decided that I didn't just want to be in the mix of technological progress but rather on the front lines. I chose Python due to its versatility and widely adopted usage to maximize my exposure to new opportunity, including that in the emerging AI and machine learning sector. I would love to be surrounded with like minded critical thinkers and problem solvers and approach new challenges with tenacity and resilience and with a chance to create something that helps everyday people. My prior experience working with the direct public, high profile clientele, and cross functional orgs help to give me a deeper understanding of problem domains on a broader scope.* 

4. What excites me most about tech is our ability to reach past our current limitations and dare to imagine what could be that isn't already, or how that would impact the course of our history. I've always believed that tech is in a unique position to consistently show us the best and worst of our inhibitions, the extremes and how far we're willing to go beyond that.
